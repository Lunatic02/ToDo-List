<h4>I created this project while following John Smilga's course. In this course, he was creating a "Grocery Budget App", so I used the same code and created a TODO-LIST. This course helped me a lot with communication between components and handling functions. I feel more motivated to do a react project on my own, and since I finished that, I will start working on my own projects.</h4>
